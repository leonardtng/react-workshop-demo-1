## ‚ùì Notes

The objective of the first session of Introduction to React is to create a website that utilises the useState hook. Do use the code here as reference if you encounter any obstacles! You can view the code for a beefed up counter website [here](https://github.com/leonardtng/fancy-counter), and a live demo of it can be found [here](http://fancy-counter.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/)!
